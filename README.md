## üì± How to Use

### Daily Practice

1. Open the app to see today's practice items
2. Complete items by clicking "Mark Complete"
3. Track your progress with the completion counter
4. Completed items will reappear based on their recurrence settings

### Managing Items

1. Click "Manage Items" to add, edit, or delete practice items
2. Create categories to organize your exercises
3. Set how often each item should reappear (in days)
4. Create sub-items for complex pieces (e.g., different movements)

### Categories

Default categories include:
- Scales
- Chords  
- Pieces
- Technique
- Theory
- Sight Reading

You can add, edit, or delete categories as needed.

## üíæ Data Storage

**Important**: This app uses your browser's localStorage to save data. This means:

- ‚úÖ **Pros**: No server required, works offline, fast and responsive
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Data is tied to your browser/device, clearing browser data will delete your practice history

### Data Backup

While the app doesn't have built-in export/import yet, your data is stored in localStorage under these keys:
- `practice_items`
- `practice_categories` 
- `practice_completions`

You can backup this data using browser developer tools or by adding export functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

The app is built with modular JavaScript, making it easy to customize:

- **`utils.js`**: Helper functions and utilities
- **`storage.js`**: All data management and localStorage operations
- **`app.js`**: Main application logic and UI management
- **`styles.css`**: All styling and responsive design
- **`index.html`**: HTML structure and layout

### Common Customizations

1. **Change default recurrence days**: Edit the default value in `index.html` (line with `value="7"`)
2. **Add new categories**: Modify the `defaultCategories` array in `utils.js`
3. **Customize styling**: Edit `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, or layouts
4. **Modify recurrence logic**: Update the `getTodaysItems()` method in `storage.js`

## üéØ Tips for Effective Practice

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a few key exercises rather than overwhelming yourself
2. **Set Realistic Recurrence**: 
   - Daily practice items: 1 day
   - Technical exercises: 2-3 days
   - Review pieces: 7 days
   - Long-term goals: 14-30 days
3. **Use Sub-items**: Break complex pieces into manageable sections
4. **Regular Review**: Use the management view to adjust recurrence as you improve
5. **Pause When Needed**: Use the pause feature during busy periods instead of deleting items

## üîß Troubleshooting

### App Not Loading
- Ensure all files are in the same directory
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try opening in an incognito/private browser window

### Data Lost
- Data is stored locally in your browser
- Clearing browser data will delete your practice history
- Use the same browser and device for consistent access

### GitHub Pages Not Working
- Ensure repository is public
- Check that `index.html` is in the root directory
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling Pages for deployment
- Check the Pages settings and build status
